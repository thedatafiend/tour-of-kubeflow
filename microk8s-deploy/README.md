# Deploy Kubeflow On a Local MicroK8s Installation
This tutorial walks you through how to deploy Kubeflow locally to a MicroK8s installation running on a personal box. It assumes you are using `v1.21` of MicroK8s and Ubuntu 20.04. 

> ***NOTE:*** There are alternative installation instructions for installing MicroK8s on Windows. The link will be in the installation section.

* Kubeflow General Installation Guide On Any Conformant Kubernetes ([link](https://charmed-kubeflow.io/docs/install))

## MicroK8s Installation (Ubuntu)
```
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --channel=1.21/stable
```

MicroK8s is super light weight, so it runs a super low resource version of K8s. However, there are a few services we will need (and want) at a minimum to run Kubeflow.Enable the `storage`, `dns`, `ingress`, `metallb` and `dashboard` services for MicroK8s

```
microk8s enable dns storage ingress dashboard metallb:10.64.140.43-10.64.140.49
```

You can see that we added some detail when enabling MetalLB, in this case the address pool to use. More info [here](https://microk8s.io/docs).

## Install Juju
Juju is an operation Lifecycle manager(OLM) for clouds, bare metal or Kubernetes. We will use it to deploy and manage the different components that make up Kubeflow.

```
sudo snap install juju --classic
juju bootstrap microk8s
juju add-model kubeflow
```

## Deploy Kubeflow (Lite)
You can opt to deploy a full Kubeflow installation. However, in order to make that feasible, you need at least 4 cores, 12GB of RAM, and 60GB of storage that are free to use on your local cluster. For laptop or smaller deployments, going with the *lite* bundle is the best way to get your feet wet.

```
juju deploy kubeflow-lite --trust
```

You can watch the status of the deployment by using the following command (it will take several minutes to get the Kubeflow deployment completed)

```
watch -c juju status --color
```

> ***NOTE:***  You can move on to the next post-installation steps while waiting for the deployment to finish

## Post-deployment Configuration
For authentication and allowing access to the Kubeflow UI, some components (e.g. `dex`) need to be configured with the ingress URL to be allowed. Since we are setting this up as a local Microk8s installation, we know what that URL will be.

> ***WARNING:***  Finding the URL: If you have a different setup for microk8s, or you are adapting this tutorial for a different Kubernetes, you can find the URL required by examining the IP address of the `istio-ingressgateway` service. For example, you can determinine this information using kubectl: `microk8s kubectl -n kubeflow get svc istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'`

```
juju config dex-auth public-url=http://10.64.140.43.nip.io
juju config oidc-gatekeeper public-url=http://10.64.140.43.nip.io
```

### Simple Authentication
To enable simple authentication and set a username and password for your Kubeflow deployment:

```
juju config dex-auth static-username=admin
juju config dex-auth static-password=password
```

## Accessing the Kubeflow Dashboard
Once Kubeflow is fully deployed and you have set up your authentication above, you can access the dashboard by going to the URL we set up in the above step: `http://10.64.140.43.nip.io`
